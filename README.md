# SpellingPlatformer

An educational platformer game where you spell words!

# What’s its purpose?

The objective of the game is to spell a random word by controlling a character using basic inputs by navigating towards the letters that are composed of that word. The game is educational as unfamiliar words may arise and the player has to spell it letter by letter. This can result in the expansion of their vocabulary and better letter recognition. The game will encourage the users to beat their own high scores in a gamified approach. Definitions will additionally be given on the screen. The outcome is a tile-based platformer game so users can practise advanced movement techniques whilst learning at the same time!
